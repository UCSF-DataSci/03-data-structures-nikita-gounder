Daily Quote Generator

This script selects a random quote for the day and prints it. Optional: The same quote should be generated for a given day.

Your task:
1. Complete the get_quote_of_the_day() function
2. Set up a cron job to run this script daily at 8:00 AM and append the output to a file

Hint: Look up `random.choice()` to select a random item from a list. You can use the `date` module to get the current date and set a seed for the random number generator.
